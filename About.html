                Seth Mukand Lal reportedly bore the entire expenditure incurred in the holding of All India Congress Sessions on the banks of river Ravi, Lahore in 1929 where resolution for complete independence of India was adopted. 
                Illiterate himself, he vowed to dispel the darkness of ignorance by opening educational institutions in the part of the country. 
                Hence, he established Mukand Lal National High School at Abdulapur (now Yamuna Nagar) as the first institution of the Mukand chain.

                Seth Jai Parkash his illustrious son accelerated the Pace of opening institutions in the name of his father.
                 A selfless man, he motivated the rich, particularly the business community by saying “Rain water accumulates on the roof top without an outlet, shall bring down the roof. Likewise, wealth without charity will ruin the household of wealthy.” 
                He acted on this principle till the last and contributed large sums of money to the educational institutions.
                <br><br>
                Shri Swatantar Kumar, Shri Ashok Kumar and Shri Vijay Kumar carried on the tradition of their ancestors and opened a number of institutions. 
                Shri Ashok Kumar, Chairman, Seth Jai Parkash Mukand Lal Institutions of Knowledge and Service, has been guiding the destinies of these institutions with the active assistance of his younger brother Shri Vijay Kumar, who is doing his best to promote Technical Education.
                 Uncompromising on quality in terms of recruitment of faculty, infrastructure and library, he encourages and motivates everyone around him to follow the guidelines and remains strict about the fiscal discipline.
                 It is because of his efforts that Seth Jai Parkash Mukand Lal Institutions are compared favorably with the some of the best in our country.
