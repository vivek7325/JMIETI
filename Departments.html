 <p align="left">Computer science or computing science (sometimes abbreviated CS) is the 
study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation, and of practical 
techniques for their implementation and application in computer systems. It is frequently 
described as the systematic study of algorithmic processes that create, describe, and transform 
information. Computer science has many sub-fields; some, such as computer graphics, 
emphasize the computation of specific results, while others, such as computational complexity 
theory, study the properties of computational problems. Still others focus on the challenges in 
implementing computations.
 <br> <br>
 For example, programming language theory studies approaches to describe computations, 
while computer programming applies specific programming languages to solve specific 
computational problems, and human-computer interaction focuses on the challenges in making 
computers and computations useful, usable, and universally accessible to people.
 <br><br>
 The general public sometimes confuses computer science with careers that deal with 
computers (such as information technology), or think that it relates to their own experience of 
computers, which typically involve activities such as gaming, web-browsing, and wordprocessing. However, the focus of computer science is more on understanding the properties 
of the programs used to implement software such as games and web-browsers, and using that 
understanding to create new programs or improve existing ones.

 Civil engineering is the broadest of the engineering fields. Civil engineering focuses on 
the infrastructure of the world which include Water works, Sewers, Dams, Power Plants, 
Transmission Towers/Lines, Railroads, Highways Bridges, Tunnels, Irrigation Canals, River 
Navigation, Shipping Canals, Traffic Control, Mass Transit, Airport Runways, Terminals, 
Industrial Plant Buildings, Skyscrapers, etc.
 <br><br>
 Among the important subdivisions of the field are construction engineering, irrigation 
engineering, transportation engineering, soils and foundation engineering, geodetic 
engineering, hydraulic engineering, and coastal and ocean engineering.
